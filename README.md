GLFW WebGPU Extension
=====================

This is an extension for the great [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) library for using it with **WebGPU native**. It was written as part of the [Learn WebGPU for native C++](https://eliemichel.github.io/LearnWebGPU) tutorial series.

Overview
--------

This extension simply provides the following function:

```C
WGPUSurface glfwGetWGPUSurface(WGPUInstance instance, GLFWwindow* window);
```

Given a GLFW window, `glfwGetWGPUSurface` returns a WebGPU *surface* that corresponds to the window's back-end. This is a process that is highly platform-specific, which is why I believe it belongs to GLFW.

Usage
-----

Just copy `glfw3webgpu.h` and `glfw3webgpu.c` to your project's source tree. Your project must link to an implementation of WebGPU (providing `webgpu.h`) and of course to GLFW.

Example
-------

Thanks to this extension it is possible to simply write a fully cross-platform WebGPU hello world:

```C
#include "glfw3webgpu.h"

#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>
#include <webgpu.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
	// Init WebGPU
	WGPUInstanceDescriptor desc;
	desc.nextInChain = NULL;
	WGPUInstance instance = wgpuCreateInstance(&desc);

	// Init GLFW
	glfwInit();
	glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CLIENT_API, GLFW_NO_API);
	GLFWwindow* window = glfwCreateWindow(640, 480, "Learn WebGPU", NULL, NULL);

	// Here we create our WebGPU surface from the window!
	WGPUSurface surface = glfwGetWGPUSurface(instance, window);
	printf("surface = %p", surface);

	// Terminate GLFW
	while (!glfwWindowShouldClose(window)) glfwPollEvents();
	glfwDestroyWindow(window);
	glfwTerminate();

	return 0;
}
```

**NB** The linking process depends on the implementation of WebGPU that you are using. You can find detailed instructions for the `wgpu-native` implementation in [this Hello WebGPU chapter](https://eliemichel.github.io/LearnWebGPU/getting-started/hello-webgpu.html). You may also check out [`examples/CMakeLists.txt`](examples/CMakeLists.txt).
